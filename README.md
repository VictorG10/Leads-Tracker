This is chrome extension that enable you keep track of important websites that you will definitely need at a future date. It cuts out the stress of having to remember the particular place or time you saw something that is very important or actually having to write it down on a piece of paper, so that you don't forget it, with this extension you can always access it at any given time or place.

Thanks.
